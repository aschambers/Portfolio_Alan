	        This was a project Alan worked on during project week after learning Python for three weeks at Coding Dojo. The goal of this project was to provide a more efficient dispatch efficiency system. Alan used to work at AT&T and saw room for improvement with their current dispatch efficiency program and thought about the application of it when being applied to other businesses such as Comcast or Food Delivery. This project used a MVC framework called Pylot. The twilio API was also used in this project to demonstrate calling and texting. You can look at this project by visiting https://github.com/aschambers/Swift-Shift. There are project you would not be able to see without looking at the project such as the admin dashboard as Alan set this up so that only he would be able to add and delete employeees, or other functions associated with an admin account.
